        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol class="list-text">
                <li>Remove the stems and seeds from the anchos, pasillas, and guajillos.</li>
                <li>Boil 3 cups of chicken stock, and cover the chilis with them. Let them steam, covered with plastic wrap, for around thirty minutes, until they are plump and tender.</li>
                <li>Cut 2 pounds of boneless pork shoulder into 1/2" pieces, season with salt and pepper, and brown the meat in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat with enough vegetable oil to keep it from sticking.</li>

                <li>Stir in the chilis, and let simmer for another forty five minutes, or until the meat is tender and the sauce is a thick, mahogany-red color.</li>
                <li>Season with salt and pepper, and serve with tortillas.</li>
            </ol>
